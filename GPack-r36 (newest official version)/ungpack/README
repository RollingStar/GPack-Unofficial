ungpack r9


Merge program for related images

Usage:
ungpack [ops] some_name.grp

[ops]
Unpack by index: -ui=#,...,# --unpack-index=#,...,#
    Comma delimited list containing index of image in grp to unpack.
    For example, -u=0,3,4 specifies that images on the 1st, 4th and 5th
    lines of the .grp should be unpacked

Unpack by tags: -ut=#,...,# --unpack-tags=#,...,#
    Comma delimited list containing tags to unpack.
    For example, -ut=!,pal specifies that any images with a tag of "!"
    or "pal" should be unpacked
    Wrap the entire -ut option in quotes if any tags have spaces

Unpack by partial filename matches: -um=#,...,# --unpack-matching=#,...,#
    Comma delimited list containing partial matches to filename to unpack.
    For example, -u=USA specifies that any images containing "USA"
    in the filename should be unpacked
    Wrap the entire -um option in quotes if any filename matches have spaces

Delete merged files: -d --delete
    Delete merged files if program executes successfully.
    NOTE: use at your own risk. Program may execute successfully yet not unpack
          every image. Incompatible with test or partial unpack options

Test mode: -t --test
    Simulate decode, same as normal operation except the images are not created

Ignore padding: --pad-no
    For system decodes, ignore padding even if present (output is scrubbed)

Pause on completion: --pause
    Wait for user interaction at the end of execution

Notes:
 <1> A WARNING indicates that a non-critical routine failed, execution
     continues as it may be recoverable. Does not affect resulting images
 <2> An ERROR indicates that a critical routine failed, execution stops.
     Any resulting images if created should be checked
 <3> Temporary files may need to be manually removed in the event of a
     WARNING or an ERROR
 <4> Ensure you have enough hdd space before merging or unmerging
 <5> Always make a backup of data before use, to avoid potential data loss
