Installation involves putting the necessary binaries in the PATH (ungpack,
gparse, 7z, ffmpeg, srep).

Supplied:
* ungpack (elf32 + source)
* gparse (elf32 + source)

To be sourced from elsewhere:
* 7z is probably already installed. If not, you need to install p7zip
* ffmpeg is for decoding tak audio, it needs to be relatively recent (stable
  versions 1.1 and 1.2 support tak): http://www.ffmpeg.org
* srep: http://freearc.org/research/SREP.aspx

For those unfamiliar with linux:
* Put binaries in /usr/bin. You may need to be root
* If running a binary gives permission denied error, change permissions with
  "chmod 755 the_binary". You may need to be root

Once installed, run ungpack from commandline via 'ungpack'
